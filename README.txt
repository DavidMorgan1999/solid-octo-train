Basically just creating a small wordle-like game to keep coding in some fashion. Very basic at the moment, takes an input guess (currently commented out and replaced with hardcoded "beans") and returns a score for each letter.
The scoring is obviously very similar to the Wordle game 0 equivlent to grey, 1 equivalent to yellow, 2 equivalent to green.
Created in kaggle as eventually want to have a small AI created to supply the guesses.
